1. Diameter of the scatter pegs
2. Distance between pegs to the left (increase to create a bias distribution to the right)
3. Distance between pegs to the right (increase to create a bias distribution to the left)(let both distances equal for a balanced normal distributuin)
4. number of rows of pegs

5. Diameter of free falling sphere
6. Number of spheres in orinal position in x directoon
7. Number of rows of these specific number of horizantal spheres(eg. to create 1000 speheres could have 40 rows(z) of 25 spheres(x))
